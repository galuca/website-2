<h1> Introduction of me </h1> 

<p>My name is Luis Felipe Manrique Bowen but you can just call me Luis. I was originally born in the paradise of Venezuela. I immigrated to the United States roughly about nine years ago. I grow up in Miami as a teenager. I graduated high school with a full-ride to attended Miami Dade College (MDC) for two years. Now I am attending Virginia Tech to pursue a bachelors degree in civil engineering. My long term goal is to become a professional engineer by doing a MS and acquiring my license.</p>
